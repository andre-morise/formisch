# Formisch for Svelte

Formisch is a schema-based, headless form library for Svelte. It manages form state and validation. It is type-safe, fast by default and its bundle size is small due to its modular design. Try it out in our [playground](https://stackblitz.com/edit/formisch-playground-svelte)!

Formisch is also available for [Preact][formisch-preact], [Qwik][formisch-qwik], [SolidJS][formisch-solid], and [Vue][formisch-vue].

## Highlights

- Small bundle size starting at 2.5 kB
- Schema-based validation with Valibot
- Type safety with autocompletion in editor
- It's fast – DOM updates are fine-grained
- Minimal, readable and well thought out API
- Supports all native HTML form fields

## Example

Every form starts with the `createForm` function. It initializes your form's store based on the provided Valibot schema and infers its types. Next, wrap your form in the `<Form />` component. It's a thin layer around the native `<form />` element that handles form validation and submission. Then, you can access the state of a field with the `useField` function or the `<Field />` component to connect your inputs.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createForm, Field, Form } from '@formisch/svelte';
  import * as v from 'valibot';

  const LoginSchema = v.object({
    email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
    password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
  });

  const loginForm = createForm({ schema: LoginSchema });
</script>

<Form of={loginForm} onSubmit={(output) => console.log(output)}>
  <Field of={loginForm} path={['email']}>
    {#snippet children(field)}
      <div>
        <input {...field.props} input={field.input} type="email" />
        {#if field.errors}
          <div>{field.errors[0]}</div>
        {/if}
      </div>
    {/snippet}
  </Field>
  <Field of={loginForm} path={['password']}>
    {#snippet children(field)}
      <div>
        <input {...field.props} input={field.input} type="password" />
        {#if field.errors}
          <div>{field.errors[0]}</div>
        {/if}
      </div>
    {/snippet}
  </Field>
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</Form>
```

In addition, Formisch offers several functions (we call them "methods") that can be used to read and manipulate the form state. These include `focus`, `getErrors`, `getAllErrors`, `getInput`, `insert`, `move`, `remove`, `replace`, `reset`, `setErrors`, `setInput`, `submit`, `swap` and `validate`. These methods allow you to control the form programmatically.

## Comparison

What makes Formisch unique is its framework-agnostic core, which is fully native to the framework you are using. It works by inserting framework-specific reactivity blocks when the core package is built. The result is a small bundle size and native performance for any UI update. This feature, along with a few others, distinguishes Formisch from other form libraries. My vision for Formisch is to create a framework-agnostic platform similar to [Vite](https://vite.dev/), but for forms.
